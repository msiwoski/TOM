        <h1>About Thirst Of Man</h1>
        <h4>Who we are?</h4>
        <p>
            We are a group of individuals, friends if you had to define it, who live in the Metro Vancouver Area and we vary in backgrounds, from Construction to Tech to Municipal Services.
        </p>
        <h4>Why Beer? Why Now?</h4>
        <p>
            Being the people that we are we are proud, opinionated individuals, but there is one thing in common we can all agree on: We love Beer.
        </p>
        <h4>Beer is Our Community</h4>
        <p>
            The BC craft beer market is growing at such an incredible pace, it is becoming more difficult to keep up with what you did and did not enjoy. That's where we come in. We will let you know what our experience was like so that you don't have to feel so confused as to what you should drink. <br><br> With such fantastic breweries in Metro Vancouver such as Parallel 49, R&B Brewing, Four Winds and Brassneck, we are only beginning our journey down the wonderful road that is beer. <br><br> We hope that you enjoy this website and our reviews and comments on the local market. We hope that we haven't offended anyone either as that is not our intentions. We would just like to share our honest reviews with the general public so that the consumer can make a more intelligent choice next time at the liquor store.
